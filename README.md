The **Odometer Input** component is like a fancy 3D combination lock digit, perfect for when you need to lasso up some numeric input from your users. With this here component, you can wrangle those digits with style and flair, just like a true cowboy ought to.

### Usage

Sling this here component into your Angular project:

```typescript
import { OdometerInputComponent } from 'angular-3d-components';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    OdometerInputComponent,
    // ...
  ],
  imports: [
    // ...
  ],
})
export class YourModule { }
```

And in your HTML, use the `<odometer-input>` tag to display the component:

```html
<odometer-input [min]="0" [max]="9" [(value)]="odometerValue"></odometer-input>
```

## Orbiting Text üåµ

Now ain't this just the darnedest thing you've ever seen? Introducing the **Orbiting Text** component, a sphere-dancin' marvel that'll have your text swirling and twirling 'round like tumbleweeds in the wind.

### Usage

Stake your claim on this component by declarin' it in your module:

```typescript
import { OrbitingTextComponent } from 'angular-3d-components';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    OrbitingTextComponent,
    // ...
  ],
  imports: [
    // ...
  ],
})
export class YourModule { }
```

Then in your HTML, use the `<orbiting-text>` tag to give your text that rodeo-worthy spin:

```html
<orbiting-text text="Howdy, partner!"></orbiting-text>
```
